  🔤 Letter Learning App
</h1>


## [Letters App](https://letters-sigma.vercel.app/)

My daughter is still learning the names of her letters. I had recently watched Wes Bos's video on the browser's built-in voice recognition. I wanted to give it a try so I built a small letter voice recognition game with NextJS 

## 🚀 Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/csellis/letters.git
cd letters
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

## 🧐 What's inside?

This project is built with [NextJS][nextjs], [TailwindCSS][tailwind], & [Vercel][vercel]. 

## 💫 Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
